# DigitalFarming
The main of this Project is to help farmers in remote locations by assessing their lands and giving the amount of irrigation and fertilizer required sections of land to ensure judicious water usage. by use of android phone and its camera
. Motivation of the Project
Many a times, the farm land has different irrigation requirements at different sections of land depending on the moisture content of the land and to assess that sensors are required which are not readily available to the common and remote farmers. Therefore, this Android and web-based software helps the farmers to obtain required irrigation based on moisture content so that water can be used accordingly.
2. Definition of the problem
During irrigation particular patch of the farm land might require less or more water than the adjacent or any other patch of land, depending on the moisture content of that patch. Our goal is to evaluate the required amount of water for the farm land by use of digital image processing which can be accessed by local farmers by the help of the android applications and web portal without the need of costly sensors.
3. Objective
Smart agriculture using grid farming, using Android and Web interface readily available to remote and local farmers unlike sensors. Evaluation of moisture content of land by use of Image processing and Machine Learning.
Utilization of the outcome of project : This Project can be of huge use in the agricultural industry and in arid locations where irrigation needs are scarcely met, the user friendly and easy-t0-use interface makes it a huge success among rural and urban farmers alike without having to use costly sensors
